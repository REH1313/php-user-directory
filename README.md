# Connecting to MySQL
I had to use Copilot AI to be able to understand what exactly I was doing and to explain certain terms. The link was not working and I had it check for typos and errors.
Since I already had header.php, I didn't exactly need to include <!DOCTYPE> and everything after that.
It also told me to fix my userModel.php by adding global $pdo; to declare it.
The website displays a table with columns and rows but they don't seem to include the information I entered in phpMyAdmin (still trying to figure out why).
